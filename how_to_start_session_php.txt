Using sessions with the custom session manager.
Below is how you would start a new session; you would need to include this on every page you want to access the sessions, use it instead of session_start();
Starting a session:

require('session.class.php');
$session = new session();
// Set to true if using https
$session->start_session('_s', false);
 
$_SESSION['something'] = 'A value.';
echo $_SESSION['something'];
